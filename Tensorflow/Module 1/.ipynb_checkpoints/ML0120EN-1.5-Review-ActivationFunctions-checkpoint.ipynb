    "## The Linear Unit functions\n",
    "Linear Units are the next step in activation functions. They take concepts from both Step and Sigmoid functions and behave within the best of the two types of functions. Linear Units in general tend to be variation of what is called the Rectified Linear Unit, or ReLU for short.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<img width=\"384\" alt=\"Activation - ReLU\" src=\"https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/kblfxapmiioh20q6vmtd6qu579w689nz.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "While it may seem counterintuitive to utilize a pseudo-linear function instead of something like Sigmoids, ReLUs provide some benefits which might not be understood at first glance. For example, during the initialization process of a Neural Network model, in which weights are distributed at random for each unit, ReLUs will only activate approximately only in 50% of the times -- which saves some processing power. Additionally, the ReLU structure takes care of what is called the **Vanishing and Exploding Gradient** problem by itself. Another benefit -- if not only marginally relevant to us -- is that this kind of activation function is directly relatable to the nervous system analogy of Neural Networks (this is called *Biological Plausibility*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReLU structure has also has many variations optimized for certain applications, but those are implemented on a case-by-case basis and therefore aren't in the scope of this notebook. If you want to know more, search for *Parametric Rectified Linear Units* or maybe *Exponential Linear Units*."
